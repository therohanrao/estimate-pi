# estimate-pi
A simple program which estimates the value of pi!

# Python Version
  - run with python3
  - program will prompt for a number 
  - higher integer numbers better approximate pi
  
 # C version
  - must compile with -lm flag for math.h library
  - provide argument to executable like so:
      ```bash
      ./exefile arg
      ```
  - like python version, higher integer numbers better approximate pi
